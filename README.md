# BulkFileReader

This reads any file and outputs it into a text file. It can take multiple files and output everything to one text file.
The inspiration for this project is because for every java coursework I was give, I had to copy all the code and paste it into a word document so that it can be processed by turnitin. 



## Instructions -
  1. Clone the project.
  2. Add all the files to be read to the 'Input Files' folder.
  3. Run the program.
  4. The output is present in the 'output.txt' file.
